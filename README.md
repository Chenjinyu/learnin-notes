  - Supports various data formats and tools, including Apache Spark.
  - Integrates with cloud storage and security in your cloud account.
  - Provides tools for data exploration, visualization, and model building.
  - Includes MLflow, an open-source platform for managing the ML lifecycle.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Building and deploying ETL pipelines.
  - Processing large datasets.
  - Developing and deploying ML Models.
  - Collaborating on data projects.
 
### Kubeflow
- **Focus**: Deploying and managing ML workflows on Kubernetes.
- **Key Features**:
  - Simplifies the deployment and management of ML workflows on Kubernetes. 
  - Provides tools for training, tuning, and deploying ML models. 
  - Supports various ML frameworks, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.
